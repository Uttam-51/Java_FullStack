<!-- 
Task: 
    o Create a JavaScript program to perform the following: 
        - Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers using arithmetic operators. 
        - Use comparison operators to check if two numbers are equal and if one 
          number is greater than the other. 
        - Use logical operators to check if both conditions (e.g., a > 10 and b < 5) are 
          true.
